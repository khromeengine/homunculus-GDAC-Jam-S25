## Concept ##

### Pitch ###
Short story game where you need to match output with two meters on screen. The meters change separately, so you need to be able to process both at the same time. 

### Story Premise ### 
You are an intern for an illegal operation to grow an artificial lifeform that's under siege by the authorities. The entire time, you're directed by your supervisor who's strangely fixated on this project. (Think FNaF Phone Guy in terms of game presence.) 

### Initial Story Details (Subject to Change) ###
You're being threatened with death to continue working on this project despite the conditions. Over the course of the game, the facility starts to crumble as the authorities continue their siege, making your job harder.

For example: 
- the pipes you're using to grow the creature might start leaking
- the facility shaking, causing sudden changes in the meters.

## Game Specifications ##
Made in Godot 4.4.1. Additional information TBD.
